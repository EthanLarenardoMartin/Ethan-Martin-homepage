        <p> While I am still a beginner at languages like HTML, Python, and JavaScript, I take pride in what I learned so far these past two semesters and more in the years to come. I also have about 2 years of experience in Stage Production, specifically Lighting, from doing it in High School. Because of my growing experience in both these fields, in 5 years I find myself doing either software development or working for a theater company. There isn't a specific company in mind for either of these, but I wouldn't mind working for anyone who has a passion in what they are trying to produce.</p>
